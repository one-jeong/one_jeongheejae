# Purpose

* When the new semester begins, freshmen enter the school. And at lunch time, they look for some restaurant around the University. But they don't have information about restaurants for example menu, price, food tatse etc. So we try to create a restaurant information site for them. We want them to get restaurants information by looking at our site.

* At the lunch or dinner time, sometimes, students are in agony to select their today's food menu. "What do you want to eat today?" And answer is "I can eat anything." or "Everything what you want". So, controversy begins to select the menu. Our site is also effective in this situation by seeing restaurant map at a glance. The site relieve their worries about menu.
